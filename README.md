# Optimizing Automated Theorem Proving

A resolution-theorem-prover (RTP) responds to queries on a knowledge-base consisting of rules and facts. When given a statement, an RTP attempts to resolve the provided statement with statements in the knowledge-base. When running the RTP, the order in which these axioms are processed can significantly influence the time required to resolve a statement if such a resolution exists, as the search-space increases exponentially with additional statement. My objective of this research is to develop hypotheses relating to the order in which the RTP navigates the resolution trees.
