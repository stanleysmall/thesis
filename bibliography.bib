abstract="Sledgehammer, a component of the interactive theorem prover Isabelle, finds proofs in higher-order logic by calling the automated provers for first-order logic E, SPASS and Vampire. This paper is the largest and most detailed empirical evaluation of such a link to date. Our test data consists of 1240 proof goals arising in 7 diverse Isabelle theories, thus representing typical Isabelle proof obligations. We measure the effectiveness of Sledgehammer and many other parameters such as run time and complexity of proofs. A facility for minimizing the number of facts needed to prove a goal is presented and analyzed.",

abstract="Smart premise selection is essential when using automated reasoning as a tool for large-theory formal proof development. This work develops learning-based premise selection in two ways. First, a fine-grained dependency analysis of existing high-level formal mathematical proofs is used to build a large knowledge base of proof dependencies, providing precise data for ATP-based re-verification and for training premise selection algorithms. Second, a new machine learning algorithm for premise selection based on kernel methods is proposed and implemented. To evaluate the impact of both techniques, a benchmark consisting of 2078 large-theory mathematical problems is constructed, extending the older MPTP Challenge benchmark. The combined effect of the techniques results in a 50Â {\%} improvement on the benchmark over the state-of-the-art Vampire/SInE system for automated reasoning in large theories.",
